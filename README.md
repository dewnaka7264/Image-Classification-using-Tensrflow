Summary of the Workflow
Load and preprocess data: Load the MNIST dataset and normalize it.
Build the model: Create a CNN with layers for feature extraction.
Compile the model: Define the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
Train the model: Train the model with the training data.
Evaluate the model: Check the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
Visualize results: Plot the training history to observe the learning process.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict unseen data
